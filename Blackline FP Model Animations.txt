Blackline FP Model Animations

Weapon recoil is dynamic, done through code and Unity's Animation Rigging system with IK. For this reason, weapons firing animations should only animate the moving parts, but not any "kickback".

Weapon Animator Controllers in Unity have Layers. If the weapon has features, that behave differently depending on the weapon being loaded for example, the Layers should be utilized. 

Replace "Weapon" with the actual weapon name, eg. "ARC-16". Note, that not all weapons will necessarily need all of these animations.

For weapon only animations:
-Weapon_Loaded
-Weapon_Empty
-Weapon_FireMode0
-Weapon_FireMode1
-Weapon_Fire

-ViktorFP_Weapon_Draw
